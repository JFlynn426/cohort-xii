      <p>JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interpreted or JIT-compiled programming language with first-class functions.
        While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it,
        such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, dynamic
        language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.</p>
